# Artboard presets for social media images
This is a Plugin for [Sketch App](http://www.sketchapp.com) that adds artboard presets for the most common image dimensions of
different social media headers and Ad Banners.

This is a simple fork of the plugin Aocial Artboards by herrhelms (https://github.com/herrhelms/social-artboards-sketch) that I adjusted to my own needs.

## Installation
Start the installation routine (once) within the Sketch App itself. Either goto the plugins menu and select Social Media Artboards -> Install Artboard Presets

### What's inside
A couple of common social media headers and Ad banners artboard presets with different pixel dimensions. If you hear these sizes change, please feel free to report an issue in this repo.

You can fork and contribute to the code and extend this package - I will happily merge any tested PRs.
